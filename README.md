## 2. System Explanation
This project consists of an **online book exchange platform** designed to facilitate communication between readers who want to give away a book while receiving another in return. The main idea is to promote the circulation of books, avoid waste, and increase the accessibility of reading materials.

Main functionalities include:
- User registration and profile management
- Book registration, management, and search
- Sending and receiving exchange requests
- Exchange workflow management (accept, reject, cancel, confirm)
- Exchange evaluation and history
- Email notifications about potential exchanges
- Administrative features (remove users, remove books)

## 3. Technologies
The system uses a simple and robust technology stack suitable for rapid prototyping and development:

- **Front-end:**
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building user interfaces
  - Prototyping and design in Figma

- **Back-end:**  
  - Python with **Django Framework**, chosen for its reliability, built-in user authentication, and rapid development capabilities

- **Database:**  
  - **SQLite**, a lightweight database suitable for development and testing environments

This stack allows the team to develop both front-end and back-end features efficiently, while ensuring smooth integration between system components.
